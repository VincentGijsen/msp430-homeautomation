## About:
This hardware/software enables home-automation based nodes


Currently due to the code-size, only the
- MSP430G2453
- MSP430G2553
Are supported as 'value' series msp's

Aditionally you'll need the NRF24L01(+) radio's (which can be bought for ~ $1 a piece, from ebay)

The software relies on the great Energia project, aswell as the libaries developt by great minds for this platform.

Yes, probably far form efficient code, but quick development in return :)
